This is a mobile application I built for studying purposes.   
  
Application has two screens: one for user login and one for chat.   
 1. It contains a simple user authentication/session system by storing unique device ids on Firebase.   
 2. It contains examples of component level and global (through Redux architecture) state. Also asynchronous actions with help of Redux middleware [redux-thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk).  
 3. There are also use cases of some general React-Native components such as View, Text, Image, Flatlist .etc and also some advanced ones such as LinearGradient.   
 4. Written entirely using React Hooks.
